I found that I'll sometimes really GO OFF on GitHub Issues and figured I ought to start a tech blog instead of bothering all these devs with my random trivia.

Thus: this blog consists of assorted bric-a-brac I've come across during my adventures down the digital rabbitholes of Computer Land. 

Specifically, I'm most likely posting about _hacking_ because:
    1) It's what I do for a living, and,
    2) Of all the ways to interact with computers, hacking is the funniest.
